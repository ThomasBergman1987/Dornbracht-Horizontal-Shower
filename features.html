            <p>Basel At Swissbau 2012 in Basel (January 17-21, 2012), kitchen and bathroom fittings manufacturer Dornbracht presented an expansion of the groundbreaking shower technology Ambiance Tuning Technique with the addition of a new application: the Horizontal Shower. With the Horizontal Shower, for the first time, showering with the Ambiance Tuning Technique can be enjoyed lying down. With this new technology, Dornbracht is expanding the vertical showering experience. The addition of a horizontal counterpart fulfils the longing for natural elements and a natural water experience. With this application, Dornbracht is once again setting a trend in the shower area. "With Horizontal Shower, we are transporting the showering experience into a new dimension," notes CEO Andreas Dornbracht.‚Äù The result is total relaxation, the kind only experienced by someone reclining. Tension in the head and muscles melts away, everyday stress is washed away with the water; body and mind are revitalized."</p>
            <p>The Horizontal Shower included six WaterBars that are recessed in a wide-area shower field located above a recliner. Just like the other applications in the Ambiance Tuning Technique various flow types can be combined, using preprogrammed choreographies of water temperature and quantity, to create the balanced, invigorating or relaxing shower experience the user seeks. The shower is controlled using the central eTool controls integrated in the head area of the recliner, making it convenient to operate while lying down. The user can enjoy the Horizontal Shower lying on his or her stomach or back and the recliner surface itself is heatable. The Horizontal Shower can be used both in private and public spas.</p>
            <p>As applications, the Horizontal and Vertical Showers are the architectural expression of a new, self-aware approach to life, an approach that seeks opportunities for a return to a decelerated and hence healthier everyday life. The aim is to use a variety of avenues to harmonize body, mind and soul with one another once again, creating a more relaxed approach to the hectic pace of life.</p>
            <p>The Horizontal Shower combines modular components of the Ambiance Tuning Technique with WaterBar water outlets. With this combination, different types of water presentation can be staged in three scenarios.</p>

            <p>HORIZONTAL SHOWERATT provides, for the first time, a reclining shower experience. The application combines six WATER BARS, set above a reclining space, with an eTOOL acting as a main control element. Three pre-programmed choreographies allow selection of BALANCING, ENERGIZING or DESTRESSING effects.</p>
            <p>Scenario 1: Balancing The water massage progresses around the body with alternating rain showers (33-38 °C) and variable water flow. Beginning at the shoulders and the soles of the feet and converging at the body's midsection, a stroking massage is experienced, lying on one’s stomach. The result is a gentle caressing of the body by the water, with a wonderfully equilibrating effect.</p>
            <p>Scenario 2: Energizing In the same reclining position (on the stomach), this scenario is extremely invigorating with a cascade-style water delivery. The water is sprayed in varying and opposing directions across the entire back, from the shoulders to the soles of the feet. Fine water jets are followed by an intensely beating rain sensation, which is then followed again by fine water jets. The sequence is enhanced by several changes in the water temperature (33-38 °C).</p>
            <p>Scenario 3: De-Stressing This scenario is enjoyed lying on one's back. The sprinkling of water is unchanging, progressing from the shoulders to the feet. Changing water temperatures and volumes create a noticeably wave-like, sweeping water flow for gentle relaxation.</p>
